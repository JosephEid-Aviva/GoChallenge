# VIN Finder

## User Story
Your task is to make use of the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration agencies API https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/ to allow users to Filter by Make, Year and Model to determine what the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) of their car model is.

The NHTSA API is to be called from the backend written in Go and the GetAllMakes (/makes) endpoint has already been implemented as a starter. The Go API that you create is then to be called by the frontend which is written in TypeScript React.

Whilst there is no strictly correct way to implement this user story, it should be as user friendly as possible and ideally we would like to not show the user a list of 100s of models.

## Getting started
Pre-reqs:
- Have NPM installed
- Have Go installed

Running the backend:
- go run main.go

Running the frontend:
- npm i
- npm start
